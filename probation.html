                <h3 id="policy-3">Policy guidelines</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Probation is a duration in which the new employee gets an opportunity to learn and understand the
                    job.</li>
                  <li>The training facilities are provided by the employer, which enhances the competence of the newly
                    hired employees.</li>
                  <li>Before getting the responsibility as a permanent employee, during the probation period, the new
                    employee can adapt to the work environment of the company.</li>
                  <li>The probation period helps to gain awareness about the strengths and the areas in which the
                    employee needs improvement.</li>
                  <li>It is an opportunity to demonstrate the performance and commitment to the organization and to
                    maintain satisfactory work behaviour during the probation period. </li>
                  <li>The probation period is a duration in which the performance and behaviour of the newly hired
                    employee are monitored by his or her manager in order to check their potential as well as their
                    suitability for the job.</li>
                  <li>It is mandatory for all employees to undergo the probation period.</li>
                  <li>The probation and confirmation policy clearly stated that a new employee should meet the set
                    standard performance, should follow the code of conduct of the organization and behave in an
                    acceptable manner.</li>
                  <li>Fabevy has three months of the probation period and is also considered an extension of the
                    selection process.</li>
                  <li>The probation process begins with an appointment and the probation period starts from the date of
                    joining of the employee.</li>
                  <li>After joining, the reporting manager will assign the job to the employee and will set a standard
                    goal or target. At the end of the probation period, the set performance target and the achieved
                    performance will be compared by the reporting manager.</li>
                  <li>If the new employee fails to achieve the standard performance, then the organization may arrange a
                    training program for the improvement of performance. However, if the employee repetitive fails to
                    achieve the set performance, then the company can either extend his or her probation period or his
                    or her services can be terminated.</li>
                  <li>The new employee is bound to follow the code of conduct of the organization; in the case of
                    misconduct, the appointment of the employee will be terminated on an immediate basis.</li>
                  <li>When an employee achieves the set performance, follows the code of conduct and shows decent
                    behaviour in the organization, then on the recommendation of the manager, the HR department will
                    issue the confirmation letter.</li>

                <h4> Confirmation</h4>
                <p>As per the recommendation of the manager and the result of the behaviour performance review, the HR
                  department will issue the employment confirmation letter to the new employee.</p>
                <h3 id="3-point">Three points for Employment Confirmation</h3>
                <p>There are three important conditions that new employees should fulfil in order to get employment
                  confirmation after completion of the probation period. The reporting manager and HR department will be
                  responsible for the verification of the conditions and further issuing employment confirmation to the
                  newly hired employee.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Work performance was satisfactory as per organizational standard The HR department collects the
                    information about the role profile and the work plan on which the new employee agreed to execute.
                    The manager shall assure that the new employee is able to finish a given range of tasks within the
                    set deadlines. If there is a gap between the agreed work plans, the set targets and the actual
                    performance of the employee, then the manager shall have the authority to conclude that work
                    performance was not satisfactory. Here the HR department will ensure the interventions in terms of
                    job training, selfmanaged learning, and coaching should be provided to the new employee before as
                    well as during the work performance execution. If a new employee performs as per the set standard,
                    then the first condition of employment confirmation is fulfilled.</li>
                  <li>Leave record was satisfactory and within the limit set for a probation period</li>
                  <li>Conduct, attendance, and punctuality were good</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The recorded pattern of attendance and punctuality will be checked from the ‘Time In register’ or
                  Punching machine. It is important that new employees report to the office every day on time and
                  complete the work duration in the organization. The remarks like ‘late mark’ or ‘early out’ will have
                  a negative impact on the review process and the intention to retain the employee. The review of the
                  conduct of new employees will be compiled based on the feedback of team members. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 id="period">When the Performance is Not Satisfactory during the Probation Evaluation Period</h3>
                <p>A number of steps should be taken when the performance of the probationer is not satisfactory and
                  does not match the work standards.</p>

                  <li>The manager or HR department should discuss each unsatisfactory action/excessive leaves/ poor
                    performance with the new employee. </li>
                  <li>The manager or HR department should convey to the new employee that management is ready to help
                    him/her enhance their performance/conduct in order to achieve the acceptable standard of the
                    performance/conduct.</li>
                  <li>The options such as training, coaching, and development programs should be explored to improve the
                    performance of the new employee.</li>
                  <li>In case of issues related to conduct or attendance, a clear verbal message or a memo can be
                    generated to the new employee to clarify the standard code of conduct and allotted leave during a
                    probation period</li>
                  <li>In the case of health issues or a medical emergency, the new employee should submit the sick
                    certificate to the HR department. The decision shall be taken by the higher management regarding
                    termination/extension.</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 id="confri">Confirmation of Employment or Termination</h3>
                <p>The reporting manager will provide a recommendation regarding the employment confirmation or
                  termination of the probationary employee. In the review meeting, it is important to convey the
                  feedback to the new employee on their performance. If the new employee consistently fails to reach the
                  standard performance, then the manager should inform him or her about the deficiencies. The motive
                  behind the review meeting is to help the new employee to improve their performance and to convey to
                  them that in the case of ‘no improvement’, employment will be terminated.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 id="termi">Termination of Contract </h3>
                <p>The probationary employee who does not complete the probation period in a satisfactory manner will
                  have their appointment terminated. The termination can take place at the end of the probation period
                  or any time in between, depending on the case. No notice period shall be provided before the
                  termination of the contract. In case of misconduct, the employment will be terminated immediately.</p>
                <p>Note- In any case of conflict/dispute or requirement of special assistance during the probation
                  period, the employee can approach the HR team in the organization.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 id="extension">Extension of Probationary contract</h3>
                <p>The extension of the probationary contract is not that common but considered in a few circumstances
                  where the manager feels it necessary to extend probation to decide whether to confirm the employee or
                  terminate his or her services</p>
