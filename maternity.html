                <h1>MATERNITY LEAVE POLICY</h1>
                <p>Fabevy is taking progressive steps to assist employees during significant life events through
                  company-paid time for maternity leaves. These leave benefits are intended to allow employees paid time
                  off to bond with their children before returning to work. This policy is available to all eligible
                  employees. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 id="eligible">Eligibility</h3>
                <p>A regular female employee who has worked for a minimum period of not less than 80 days in 12 months:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>delivers a baby (i.e. birth mother), or</li>
                  <li>legally adopts a child below the age of one year (i.e. adoptive mother), or</li>
                  <li>She is a commissioning mother. A Commission mother means a biological mother who uses her egg to
                    create an embryo implanted in any other woman.</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 id="general">General guidelines</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>You will be paid 100% of the Annual Fixed Salary that you received pre leave application.</li>
                  <li>The Maternity Leave is inclusive of rest days, off days and public holidays.</li>
                  <li>Maternity Leave generally begins on the date requested by an eligible employee and must be taken
                    continuously upon the birth or adoption of the child.</li>
                  <li>To minimize business disruption, after availing of the Maternity leave, the employee cannot take
                    any additional time off immediately.</li>
                  <li>If the employee wishes to take any leave before the Maternity leave, please contact company HR to
                    discuss your specific situation.</li>
                  <li>While on a Maternity Leave, you will maintain the same benefits coverage you have as an active
                    employee (subject to plan provisions) for the full duration of the leave. If you do not return from
                    leave, these benefits will cease as of the last day of your leave.</li>
                  <li>Additional documentation and certification may be required for verification purposes.</li>
                  <li>Employees who fail to return within three days of the specified return to work date, accept other
                    employment (including self-employment) for compensation while on leave, or are found to have
                    falsified any information about the leave, including dates and reasons for the leave, will be
                    considered grounds for termination.</li>

                <h3 id="maternity-benfi">Period of maternity benefit</h3>
                <h4>Women having 1st or 2nd child:</h4>
                <p>The Maternity leave shall be of a maximum of 26 weeks, out of which not more than eight weeks shall
                  precede the expected date of her delivery. Oncea woman employee joins back services after delivery,
                  she is entitled to two breaks for nursing the child until the child is one and a half years old.</p>

                <h4>Maternity law for commissioning mothers:</h4>
