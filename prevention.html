                <p>Sexual harassment may be one or a series of incidents involving unsolicited and unwelcome sexual
                  advances, requests for sexual favours, or any other verbal or physical conduct of sexual nature.</p>
                <p>Sexual harassment at the workplace includes:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li> unwelcome sexual advances (verbal, written or physical),</li>
                  <li>demand or request for sexual favours,</li>
                  <li>any other type of sexually-oriented conduct,</li>
                  <li>verbal abuse or ‘joking’ that is sex-oriented,</li>
                  <li> Any conduct that has the purpose or the effect of interfering with an individual’s work
                    performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment and/or submission to
                    such conduct is either an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment and /or submission or
                    rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions.</li>
                  <li>Inappropriate conduct could also be a joke, a prank or even a compliment. These gestures also lead
                    to harassment, although the intention of the individual might not be to offend the other person.

                </h3>
                <p>The Company is committed to providing a supportive environment to resolve concerns of sexual
                  harassment as under</p>
                <h4>Informal Resolution Options</h4>
                <p>When an incident of sexual harassment occurs, the victim of such conduct can communicate their
                  disapproval and objections immediately to the harasser and request the harasser to behave decently.
                </p>
                <p>If the harassment does not stop or if the victim is not comfortable with addressing the harasser
                  directly, the victim can bring their concern to the attention of the Complaints Committee for
                  redressal of their grievances. The Complaints Committee will thereafter provide advice or extend
                  support as requested and will undertake a prompt investigation to resolve the matter.</p>
                <h4>Complaints</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>An employee with a harassment concern, who is not comfortable with the informal resolution options
                    or has exhausted such options, may make a formal complaint to the Presiding Officer of the
                    Complaints Committee constituted by the Management. </li>
                  <li>The complaint shall have to be in writing and can be in the form of a letter, submitted within
                    three months from the date of the incident and, in case of a series of incidents, within a period of
                    3 months from the date of the last incident. The Complaints Committee can extend the timeline for
                    filing the complaint for reasons to be recorded in writing by a period of 3 months.</li>
                  <li>Alternately, the employee can send a complaint through an email. The employee is required to
                    disclose their name, department, division and location they are working in to enable the Presiding
                    Officer to contact them and take the matter forward.</li>
                  <li>Complaints against any member of the Complaints Committee or employee in the Strategic Job
                    Responsibility Band (or equivalent) and above should be sent directly to the CMD of the Company.
                  </li>
                  <li>The Presiding Officer of the Complaints Committee will proceed to determine whether the
                    allegations (assuming them to be true only for the purpose of this determination) made in the
                    complaint fall under the purview of Sexual Harassment, preferably within 30 days from receipt of the
                    complaint.</li>
                  <li>In the event the allegation does not fall under the purview of Sexual Harassment or the allegation
                    does not constitute an offence of Sexual Harassment, the Presiding Officer will record this finding
                    with reasons and communicate the same to the complainant.</li>
                  <li>If the Presiding Officer of the Complaints Committee determines that the allegations constitute an
                    act of sexual harassment, he/ she will proceed to investigate the allegation with the assistance of
                    the Complaints Committee.</li>
                  <li>Where such conduct, on the part of the accused, amounts to a specific offence under the law, the
                    Company shall initiate appropriate action in accordance with law by making a complaint with the
                    appropriate authority.</li>
                  <p>The Complaints Committee shall conduct such investigations in a timely manner and shall submit a
                    written report containing the findings and recommendations on action to be taken to the </p>
                  <li>“Whistle Officer” appointed by the Company as soon as practically possible and, in any case, not
                    later than 90 days from the date of receipt of the complaint. The Whistle Officer, Head of Personnel
                    & Administration and the President of the Company will jointly take a decision on the corrective
                    action based on the recommendations of the Complaints Committee and keep the complainant informed of
                    the same.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Corrective action may include any of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Formal apology</li>
                  <li>Counselling</li>
                  <li>Written warning to the perpetrator and a copy of it maintained in the employee’s file.</li>

                  <li>Suspension or termination of services of the employee found guilty of the offence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In case the complaint is found to be false, the complainant shall, if deemed fit, be liable for
                  appropriate disciplinary action by the Management.</p>

                <p>The Company understands that it is difficult for the victim to come forward with a complaint of
                  sexual harassment and recognizes the victim’s interest in keeping the matter confidential. </p>
                <p>To protect the interests of the victim, the accused person and others who may report incidents of
                  sexual harassment, confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the
                  extent practicable and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 id="docu">ACCESS TO REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS</h3>
                <p>All records of complaints, including contents of meetings, results of investigations and other
                  relevant material, will be kept confidential by the Company except where disclosure is required under
                  disciplinary or other remedial processes.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 id="victim">PROTECTION TO COMPLAINANT / VICTIM</h3>
                <p>The Company is committed to ensuring that no employee who brings forward a harassment concern is
                  subject to any form of reprisal. Any reprisal will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>
                <p>The Company will ensure that the victim or witnesses are not victimized or discriminated against
                  while dealing with complaints of sexual harassment.</p>
                <p>However, anyone who abuses the procedure (for example, by maliciously putting an allegation knowing
                  it to be untrue) will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
