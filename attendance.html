              <h1>ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY GUIDELINES</h1>
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>The standard workweek schedule for all teams is as follows: <br>
                <strong>Monday to Friday:</strong> Work Shift: 9AM to 6PM <br>
                <strong> Saturday: </strong> Work Shift: 10AM to 4PM <br>
                The Dedicated Resources/ Employees working at various locations are requested to follow the work timings
                and schedule as per the guidelines. Any changes in the schedule should be informed to the HR Team.
                Every Sunday will be week off and holidays will be announced in start of every year.
                A full workday is considered only when you work for 9 hours starting from your stipulated time, and a
                half-day will be considered only when you work for 5.5 hours/ less (excluding the lunch/food break)
                starting from your stipulated time. Saturday’s full-day working will be considered on completion of 6
                hours. (The maximum limit of work hours in a day has been increased from 9 to 12 in a day, if the
                employers provide 3 weekly offs in a week – New Labour Law Code 2022)
                In the event of absence or tardiness from an assigned work schedule, the employee is required to report
                the absence to the Company. When reporting an absence, the employee must E-mail / Telephone/ SMS/
                WhatsApp his or her supervisor and any HR representative only. The employee must call within two hours
                of the scheduled start time.
                An employee’s absence will be deemed unexcused when an employee fails to call in, gives a late notice,
                fails to give advance notice for an absence which could be anticipated, exceeds the number of length of
                absences as defined by policy or authorized in advance by the Supervisor or HR. Unexcused/ uninformed
                absentees are subject to corrective disciplinary action.
                Location Heads in the respective location are requested to be alert and report us of any absence or
                tardiness of employees in their respective locations.
                Following are some points and measures that are taken, and we would like every employee to remember them
                categorically and take a note of this:
              </p>
              <h3 id="entry">Attendance Entry</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>For any attendance (IN time or OUT time) not registered on a given day, the first work e-mail (IN
                  time) and the last work e-mail (OUT Time) for the day will be considered along with a notification
                  sent to the HR Team. This is applicable for all instances like (Forgot to Clock In or Clock out –
                  online) </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="late-marks">Late marks</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Any extra minute above the stipulated Office timings will be considered to be a ‘late mark’ </li>
                <li>Any late coming, informed or uninformed will be marked under ‘late mark’, and deductions will be
                  made wherever applicable as per the rules and guidelines defined.</li>
                <li>If an employee reports working after 12.00 p.m., it will be considered as Half Day leave/salary
                  deduction. </li>
                <li>A group of three ‘late marks’ will result in a deduction of one-half day from your balance
                  leaves/salary. </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="working">Working from home</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Work from home employees should be available online (Email/Hangout/Skype/WhatsApp/SMS) and
                  accessible/ responsive at all times during the 9 hours of duty.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="leave-early">Leave early</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>In case any employee has to move out of the office for any personal reason except during lunch
                  hours, he/she is required to get prior approval from his/her immediate supervisor and keep HR posted.
                </li>
                <li>Employees can leave early only once a month for an hour’s time except for Saturdays. </li>
                <li>Early leave requests on working Saturdays will not be approved or accepted.</li>
              </ul>
